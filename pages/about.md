# Hi there!

My name is Balte. But you probably already noticed that. I am a self taught developer from the Netherlands with a passion for broadcast technologies.

I took my first baby steps with programming when I was eleven years old. Although you shouldn't think I was writing apps or actual programs. Baby steps, right?  I started actually programming when I was 14 years old on a platform called Roblox. It was the new year and I figured it would be a good new year's resolution.

After about half a year I started doing some work at a local web development company my brother worked at. It was reasonably amateuristic, but it was also my first payed programming work ever. Two years later I left for reasons unspecified to go work at a supermarket (hah, very relevant.)

Between leaving that company and my next programming gig about two years went by. I spent those two years doing volunteering at a local public broadcaster. This is how I got introduced to the broadcast world. After having attempted a small live broadcast that didn't go entirely to plan (I will never trust ftp again) I went looking online for a solution for broadcast graphics. This is how I found CasparCG, an open source character generator / video server, for which I have now programmed a fair few custom clients and templates.

CasparCG is also what got me my latest programming gig (summer '17) at [Superfly TV](https://superfly.tv), where I worked on virtualization of CasparCG and also worked on a project for their client EFN.

And now I have started my first year in a bachelor of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Technical University of Eindhoven](https://tue.nl).
