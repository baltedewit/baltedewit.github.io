In the Netherlands the public broadcasters are divided in three levels: national, regional and local. Where the national and regional levels are at a professional level, the local broadcasters at an amateur level often working with only volunteers or volunteers and one or two payed professionals. In my region the local public broadcaster [RTV Slogo](http://rtvslogo.nl) started broadcasting in 2013. From 2013 to 2015 I have made a number of videos for them. In chronological order:

There's a whole bunch from the above event, which I have collected in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPHGc_loh5M0pW8opXOuvsaaTTFVLNkpH), although none of them more interesting than the above.

Below is the first video I did completely on my own as CamJo.

This one I only did the editing of:

The video below was in particular very fun to make, since all the people who were dressed up were so friendly and joyful to work with:

Below is the first live broadcast we did. The image quality is horrible, and the audio is just radio commentary. But hey, it *was* a first step.

My camera was broken, so there's only minor contributions on camera work in this one:

The reporter in this video was so nice to work with. One of the issues I noticed is that most reporters (including this one) were used to doing radio reports, where they had to be very describing. They carried this over to television, which doesn't work as nicely.

This is one of the videos I am still the most proud of, and to this day is the second most popular video the broadcaster has produced. (there are others on the channel, but they are produced by commercial parties) This is also one of the few videos with journalistic value that was published on the same day as it was happening.

Only camerawork:

This is the last video I worked on (only camera work), and after this I fell out with the coordinator (who fell out with a lot of people there, and eventually was forced to leave by the board). I did work on live broadcasts which I will write up in a different post.
