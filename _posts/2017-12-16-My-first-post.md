So, this is it then the first post.

# Intended purpose
This website is supposed to be both an online portfolio of things I have done so far profesionally and relevant side projects but also a personal place to post ideas and opinions. The first will be found under the *Projects* section, and the second will be found under the _Blogs_ section.

# Credit where credit is due
This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com) and the Jekyll theme is developed by [Paul Le](https://twitter.com/paululele).
